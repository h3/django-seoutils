django-seoutils
===============

A simple django app to manage SEO related data with the admin.


Installation
------------

1. In your `settings.py`, add `seoutils` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`.
2. Sync your database

From there you will have a new app called `Seoutils` in the admin. Start by adding a `Meta` 
for the root page of your site. The URL will of course be `/` and the other fields are what
you think they are (page title, keywords, description, JavaScript).

The root URL will be used as default. For example, if you have a page with the URL `/contact/`,
seoutils will first check if a Meta exists for this URL and if it doesn't find one it will use
the Meta for the root page.

The JavaScript field is optional. It is meant to be used in special cases where you need to
add SEO specific scripts like campaign tracking code and such. You will need to declare it
in your template like this:

.. code-block:: django

    {{ meta.extra_js|safe }}


Using the context processor
---------------------------

This is the recommanded way to use `seoutils`.

In your `settings.py` add `seoutils.context_processors.meta` to your `TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS`.

Then in your template you will have a `meta` variable which is a `Meta` instance. So you can use it
like this:

.. code-block:: django

    <title>{{ meta.title }}</title>
    <meta name="description" content="{{ meta.desc }}">
    <meta name="keywords" content="{{ meta.keywords }}">

Using template tags
-------------------

For a more flexible approach, you can also use a template tag to retrieve a `Meta` object for a 
specific page like this:

.. code-block:: django
    
    {% load seoutils_tags %}
    {% seometa request as meta %}
    <title>{{ meta.title }}</title>
    <meta name="description" content="{{ meta.desc }}">
    <meta name="keywords" content="{{ meta.keywords }}">

Using Virtual Files
-------------------

Seoutils' Virtual Files is a simple application which makes it easy to put any kind of ASCII file
on your site on a given URL. 

For example, Google Webmaster Tools ask webdevelopers to put a file named 'google-RANDOM-HASH.html'
in the webroot. However this doesn't work with Django as URLs are managed internally.

To use Virtual Files, simply add this url to your project `urls.py`:


.. code-block:: python

    handler404 = 'seoutils.views.page_not_found'

**Note:** Django will raise a 404 normally if `settings.DEBUG` is set to `True`.


The depracated way
==================

For now you can still use the old way which use a standard URL/view, but be warned that
this can lead to URLs related headaches..

.. code-block:: python

    (r'', include('seoutils.urls')),

Since it globs any URL, it should be the last URLs. So in essence, a given url doesn't match any of the 
URLs of your project, it will search for matching Virtual Files URLs and return a 404 if none is found.

Now you can use the admin to add new Virtual Files.

If for some reason you cannot put this URL in last position, it is possible to exclude patterns in URL like this:

.. code-block:: python

    (r'^(!media/).*', include('seoutils.urls')),

**Note:** Use at your own risks.


Using Analytics
---------------

Analytics is basically just an app were you put your Analytic code snippet and then render it (or them)
like so:

.. code-block:: django

    {% load seoutils_tags %}
    {% get_analytics as analytics %}
    {{ analytics }}
